    "spiritual_invitation": "🙏 Welcome to Srisailam, the only Mahakshetra in Bharat where a Jyotirlinga and a Maha Shakti Peetha reside together—the cosmic parents of the universe, united in stone and spirit.\n\nHere, on this ancient mountain revered since Vedic times, Shiva followed his estranged son Kartikeya out of boundless parental love. Here, Shakti destroyed the demon Arunasura as a swarm of divine bees. Here, tribal and Vedic traditions merge as the Chenchu people claim the Lord as their son-in-law.\n\nYou stand at the confluence of Consciousness and Energy, of rugged wilderness and refined architecture, of forest simplicity and cosmic theology. The Krishna River thunders 800 feet below. The Nallamala forests shelter tigers and sages alike. And within the ancient walls, the Swayambhu Linga awaits—the same stone upon which Princess Chandravati laid her wild jasmine garlands millennia ago.\n\nWelcome home, pilgrim.",

The jasmine garlands of Chandravati, the vachanas of Akka Mahadevi, the devotion of the Chenchu tribes—all this sacred inheritance now flows through you.\n\nMay the buzzing of Bhramaramba's bees forever resound in your heart as the mantra of protection. May the cool touch of the Pathalaganga purify you for lifetimes. And may the vision of the Shikhara, glimpsed through Nandi's horns, guide you beyond all rebirth.\n\n🙏 ॐ श्री मल्लिकार्जुनाय नमः | ॐ श्री भ्रामरांबायै नमः 🙏"
