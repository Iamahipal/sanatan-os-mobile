    "description": "Near the sacred city of Dwarka, where Lord Krishna established his kingdom, rises another form of the divine—Nageshwar, the Lord of Serpents. This Jyotirlinga emerged to protect the devotee Supriya from the demon Daruka. Despite being imprisoned and tortured, Supriya continued chanting 'Om Namah Shivaya'—and Shiva manifested in brilliant light, destroyed the demon, and remained as Nageshwar. The temple houses an 82-foot statue of Lord Shiva in meditation—one of the largest in India. Pilgrims often combine Nageshwar with Dwarka and Bet Dwarka for a complete Saurashtra pilgrimage. The temple's location near the sea adds to its sacred atmosphere, and darshan here is said to remove all serpent-related curses and protect from poison.",
    "secret_hook": "Why is the Lord of Serpents located near Krishna's Dwarka? Some texts hint that Nageshwar protects the underwater remnants of the original Dwarka—guarding Krishna's sunken city for its prophesied re-emergence."
