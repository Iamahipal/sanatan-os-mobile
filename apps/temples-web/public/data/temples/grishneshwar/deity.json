        "form_here": "The Grishneshwar lingam is set in a modest sanctum within the smallest of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. Despite its size, the east-facing lingam radiates powerful energy. The temple's red stone construction (Hemadpanthi style) is architecturally significant.",

Her sister-in-law, jealous of Ghushma's devotion and her husband's love, repeatedly destroyed the lingam and threw it into a nearby tank. Ghushma discovered this but never complained—she simply made a new lingam each day and continued her worship without anger. After 101 such destructions, Shiva appeared. So moved was he by Ghushma's devotion AND her forgiveness that he manifested as a Jyotirlinga and named this site Ghushmeshwar (later Grishneshwar) in her honor.",

        "core_teaching": "Grishneshwar teaches that forgiveness is the highest devotion. Ghushma could have confronted her tormentor, could have harbored anger, could have appealed for justice.

        "art_and_devotion": "The proximity to Ellora—with its Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain caves—suggests that all sacred art, regardless of tradition, participates in the same devotional impulse. Devotees here can witness the full spectrum of Indian spirituality carved in stone."
