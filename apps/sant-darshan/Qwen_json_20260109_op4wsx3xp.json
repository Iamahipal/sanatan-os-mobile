    "biography": "Akka Mahadevi was a 12th-century Kannada poet-saint and one of the earliest female poets in Kannada literature. A devoted follower of Lord Shiva (whom she called Chennamallikarjuna), she rejected conventional social norms, including marriage to a local king, choosing instead a life of radical renunciation and spiritual pursuit. She wandered naked, covered only by her long hair, symbolizing her complete surrender to Shiva and rejection of societal shame. As part of the Veerashaiva (Lingayat) movement, she composed over 430 vachanas—free-verse devotional poems expressing intense longing for union with the divine. Her poetry blends mysticism, feminist critique, and philosophical depth, challenging patriarchal structures while affirming the soul’s equality before God. She joined the Anubhava Mantapa in Kalyana, a spiritual parliament of saints, where her wisdom earned respect among male contemporaries like Basavanna and Allama Prabhu.",

Orphaned at birth and raised by ascetics, he experienced a profound spiritual awakening after his wife reminded him that love for God surpasses even marital affection. He became a devoted follower of Rama and spent his life preaching bhakti through poetry, drama, and public discourse. His works revitalized Rama worship across North India and inspired festivals like Ramlila. Tulsidas emphasized moral living, devotion, and the grace of Rama as the path to liberation.

Her lyrical bhajans, composed in Braj Bhasha and Rajasthani, express intense personal love for Krishna, blending romantic longing with spiritual yearning. Over 1,000 poems are attributed to her, though scholars accept around 200–300 as authentic. Her legacy endures as a symbol of fearless devotion and feminine spiritual autonomy.",
