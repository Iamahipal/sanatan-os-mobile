        "biography": "Lalleshwari, popularly known as Lal Ded (Grandmother Lal), is a foundational figure in Kashmiri spirituality, revered by both Hindus and Muslims. She was a mystic poetess of the Kashmiri Shaivism tradition. Married into a dysfunctional family, she endured great hardship before renouncing worldly life to become a wandering ascetic. Her teachings are encapsulated in her mystical verses called 'Lal Vakhs' (Lal's Sayings), composed in the Kashmiri language. Her poetry uses everyday imagery to express profound non-dual (Advaita) philosophy, the experience of inner awakening, and criticism of ritualistic dogma. She is considered a spiritual ancestor to later saints like Nund Rishi (Sheikh Noor-ud-din Wali).",

She then prayed to Shiva to take away her physical beauty, which she saw as the cause of her worldly attachment. Granted a ghoul-like form, she became a fervent devotee, singing and dancing at Shiva's abode, Mount Kailash, and later at Tiruvalankadu. Her poems are among the first compositions of the Tirumurai and are characterized by fierce devotion and vivid imagery of Shiva's cremation grounds.",
