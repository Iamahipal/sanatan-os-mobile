Originally named Ratnakara, he was a highway robber who underwent profound transformation after encountering the sage Narada. Instructed to meditate on the name 'Rama', his intense repetition eventually produced the syllable 'Mara'—which, when reversed, became 'Rama'. Ants built anthills (valmika) around his body during meditation, giving him his new name. His Ramayana, composed in 24,000 verses across seven kandas, is not merely a narrative but a dharmic guide exploring duty, devotion, and divine incarnation. Valmiki also sheltered Sita during her exile, where she gave birth to Lava and Kusha, whom he taught the epic. He represents the power of redemption through devotion and poetic revelation.",
