    "biography": "Meerabai was a Rajput princess who transcended her royal status to become one of India's most revered Bhakti saints. From childhood, she was devoted to Lord Krishna, considering herself spiritually married to him. Despite being married to a prince, she refused to abandon her devotion. Her in-laws persecuted her, but according to legend, she was protected by Krishna through miracles. She eventually left her palace life to wander as a mendicant, singing devotional songs in the streets and temples of Vrindavan. Her bhajans (devotional songs) express the pain of separation from Krishna and the ecstasy of union with the divine. These songs, numbering in the thousands, are still sung throughout India and have become fundamental to Krishna worship. Meerabai's life exemplifies the power of devotion to transcend all worldly attachments, social conventions, and even death itself.",
