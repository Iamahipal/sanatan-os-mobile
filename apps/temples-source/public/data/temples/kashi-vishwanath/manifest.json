    "description": "Kashi Vishwanath is not merely a temple—it is the spiritual center of the universe according to Hindu cosmology. Standing in the oldest continuously inhabited city on Earth, this temple marks the exact spot where Lord Shiva's infinite column of light (Jyotirlinga) first manifested. The current structure, built in 1780 by Ahilyabai Holkar, rises from centuries of destruction and rebirth. For devotees, to die in Kashi is to achieve Moksha—liberation from the cycle of rebirth.",
