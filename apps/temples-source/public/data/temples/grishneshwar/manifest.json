    "description": "The twelfth and final Jyotirlinga stands near one of humanity's greatest artistic achievements—the Ellora Caves. Grishneshwar (also called Ghushmeshwar) is the smallest of the twelve temples, but its spiritual significance equals any. The temple was built by Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore in the 18th century in the elegant Hemadpanthi style. The legend involves a devoted woman named Ghushma whose lingam was repeatedly thrown into a nearby tank by jealous rivals. Each time she recreated it; each time she continued her worship without anger. Moved by her pure devotion and forgiveness, Shiva manifested as the Jyotirlinga. For those completing the Dwadash Jyotirlinga pilgrimage, Grishneshwar marks the sacred fulfillment. Combined with the adjacent Ellora Caves, this is a pilgrimage to both spiritual and artistic peaks of Indian civilization.",
    "secret_hook": "Why is the twelfth Jyotirlinga located next to the world's greatest cave temples? Some believe the Ellora sculptors chose this site precisely because the Jyotirlinga was already here—making their Buddhist and Jain caves part of an older sacred geography."
