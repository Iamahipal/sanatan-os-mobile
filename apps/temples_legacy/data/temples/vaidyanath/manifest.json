The temple's extraordinary legend involves Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, who performed such intense penance here that Shiva was compelled to grant him a boon. When Ravana's arms were injured during his austerities, Shiva himself healed them, earning the name Vaidyanath (Lord of Physicians). The temple complex contains 22 shrines, and the main lingam is said to have been installed by Ravana himself. Every year during Shravan month, over 20 million Kanwariyas walk hundreds of kilometers carrying sacred Ganga water to offer here—making this one of the largest annual religious gatherings on Earth. The healing energy here is palpable; countless devotees report miraculous cures.",
