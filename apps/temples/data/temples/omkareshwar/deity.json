        "origin_story": "In ancient times, both the Devas (celestial beings) and the Asuras (demons) were engaged in devotion to Shiva on the banks of the Narmada. The Devas worshipped on Mandhata Island while the Asuras performed their rituals on the opposite bank. Both parties pleased Lord Shiva with their intense tapas. When Shiva appeared to grant boons, a dispute arose—both claimed the Lord for themselves. Shiva, in his infinite wisdom, manifested in two forms: as Omkareshwar (the formless Om principle) on the island for the Devas, and as Mamleshwar (Amaleshwar) on the southern bank for the Asuras. Thus, this became the only place on Earth with two Jyotirlingas.",

The mountain on the island is still called Mandhata Parvat."
