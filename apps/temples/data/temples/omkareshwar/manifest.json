This miraculous geography hosts not one but two Jyotirlingas: Omkareshwar on the island itself and Mamleshwar (Amaleshwar) on the southern bank. Ancient texts describe how the devas and asuras both worshipped Shiva here, and the Lord, pleased by their devotion, split himself into two formsâ€”Omkar (formless, represented by Om) and Mamleshwar (with form). The island holds 68 sacred sites, and the Narmada Parikrama (circumambulation of the entire Narmada River) traditionally passes through here. Boats ferry pilgrims across the sacred waters as they have for millennia.",
    "secret_hook": "Why are there TWO Jyotirlingas here and nowhere else? Ancient texts hint at a cosmic negotiation between devas and asuras that required Shiva to manifest in dual formâ€”one for each side of the river."
