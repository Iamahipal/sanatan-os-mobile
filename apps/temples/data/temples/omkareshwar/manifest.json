    "description": "Rising from the sacred Narmada River, Mandhata Island is one of the most extraordinary sacred sites in India—naturally shaped like the cosmic symbol Om (ॐ). This miraculous geography hosts not one but two Jyotirlingas: Omkareshwar on the island itself and Mamleshwar (Amaleshwar) on the southern bank. Ancient texts describe how the devas and asuras both worshipped Shiva here, and the Lord, pleased by their devotion, split himself into two forms—Omkar (formless, represented by Om) and Mamleshwar (with form). The island holds 68 sacred sites, and the Narmada Parikrama (circumambulation of the entire Narmada River) traditionally passes through here. Boats ferry pilgrims across the sacred waters as they have for millennia.",
    "secret_hook": "Why are there TWO Jyotirlingas here and nowhere else? Ancient texts hint at a cosmic negotiation between devas and asuras that required Shiva to manifest in dual form—one for each side of the river."
