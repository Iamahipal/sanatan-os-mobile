    "description": "On a sacred island where the Indian subcontinent nearly touches Sri Lanka, Lord Rama himself established this Jyotirlinga before his epic battle with Ravana. The Ramanathaswamy Temple today is an architectural wonder—its corridors stretch over 4,000 feet, making them the longest of any temple in India. Within the complex are 22 sacred wells (theerthams), each with unique healing properties. Pilgrims bathe in each well in sequence, a practice said to wash away all sins and cure diseases. This is one of the four Char Dhams—the four corners of Hindu pilgrimage in India. The nearby Ram Setu (Adam's Bridge)—the legendary causeway Rama built to Lanka—can still be seen stretching into the ocean. To visit Rameshwaram is to walk where Rama walked, to worship where Rama worshipped.",
    "secret_hook": "NASA satellite images clearly show the underwater Ram Setu stretching toward Sri Lanka. Carbon dating suggests it was man-made, created roughly when the Ramayana describes. Did Rama's vanara army really build it?"
