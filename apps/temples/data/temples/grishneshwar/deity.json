        "origin_story": "Ghushma daily made Shivalingas and worshipped them despite persecution from her stepmother-in-law, who eventually killed her son. When Ghushma continued her devotion without faltering, Shiva appeared, restored her son, and offered to punish her tormentor. Ghushma asked for forgiveness for her enemy instead. Moved by such divine compassion, Shiva remained as Grishneshwar—literally, the Lord who takes away grief.",
        "cosmic_significance": "While other Jyotirlingas represent power, victory, or fierce protection, Grishneshwar uniquely embodies Shiva's compassionate, forgiving nature. The temple teaches that true devotion brings not revenge but the capacity for mercy—the highest spiritual attainment."
