The first and most sacred of the twelve Jyotirlingas has been destroyed by invaders 17 times, yet stands rebuilt for the 18th time, more magnificent than ever. From Mahmud of Ghazni's notorious raid in 1024 CE to the final reconstruction championed by Sardar Patel in 1951, Somnath has witnessed more violence than any sacred site on Earthâ€”and survived. Today it stands on the edge of the Arabian Sea, exactly where the legend says Soma (the Moon God) prayed to Shiva to cure his curse. Every sunset, thousands watch the Aarti as the sun sinks into the ocean behind the temple.",
