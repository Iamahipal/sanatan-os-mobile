    "description": "Hidden in the misty Sahyadri mountains, Bhimashankar is perhaps the most naturally beautiful of all Jyotirlingas. The sixth sacred light of Shiva manifested here after a cosmic battle with the demon Bhimaâ€”son of Kumbhakarna. When Bhima's tyranny threatened all three worlds, Shiva descended in his fierce Rudra form, destroyed the demon, and at the request of sages, agreed to remain forever as Bhimashankar. The sweat that poured from Shiva's body during battle became the Bhima River, which originates near the temple. Today, the historic temple complex stands surrounded by dense forests, home to the famous Indian Giant Squirrel and countless species of flora and fauna. Pilgrims climb through morning mist and ancient trees to reach the sanctumâ€”making this one of the most meditative journeys to any Jyotirlinga.",
