    "mythology": {
        "origin_story": "Ravana, the mighty king of Lanka, performed fierce penance to obtain Shiva's blessing. When Shiva seemed unmoved, Ravana began severing his own heads as offerings. Moved by this extreme devotion, Shiva appeared, healed all ten heads, and became known as Vaidyanath—the Divine Physician. Though Ravana was granted his boon, the lingam was destined to remain at Deoghar.",
        "cosmic_significance": "Vaidyanath represents Shiva's compassionate, healing aspect. While Shiva is often portrayed as the transformer through destruction, here he appears as the physician who restores wholeness. This Jyotirlinga teaches that divine grace transcends moral judgment—even Ravana received healing through sincere devotion."
