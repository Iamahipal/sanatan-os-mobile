Shiva and Parvati followed their son to console him and were so pleased with his tapasya that they decided to permanently reside here. Parvati offered jasmine garlands to Shiva, giving him the name Mallikarjuna.",

The Shiva Purana ranks it as the second Jyotirlinga, representing the complete union of Shiva (consciousness) and Shakti (energy). This duality makes it one of the most spiritually complete pilgrimage sites in Hinduism."
