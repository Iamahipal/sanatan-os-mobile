    "description": "At the sacred source of the Godavari—India's second-longest river—stands one of the most theologically unique temples in the world. The Trimbakeshwar lingam has three faces representing Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva—the only Jyotirlinga where the Trimurti appears in a single form. This wasn't always its shape; legend says the sage Gautama's prayers revealed the three-faced aspect hidden within. The temple sits at the foot of Brahmagiri hill, from whose springs the Godavari begins her 1,465 km journey to the Bay of Bengal. Every 12 years, millions gather here for the Nashik Kumbh Mela—one of the four great bathing festivals. The Kushavarta Kund, the precise spot of Godavari's origin, is considered among the holiest in India. Pilgrims perform Narayan Nagbali and Tripindi Shraddha rituals here—available at very few other sites.",
    "secret_hook": "Why does the Trimbakeshwar Jyotirlinga have THREE faces while all other Jyotirlingas have none? Ancient priests say the Trimurti form was revealed only after a sage's intense penance 'cracked' the outer layer. What else might be hidden within?"
