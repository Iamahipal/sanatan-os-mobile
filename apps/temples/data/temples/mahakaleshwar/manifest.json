    "description": "The Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga represents the absolute and terrifying aspect of the Divine as Mahakalaâ€”the Great Time, the Devourer of Time. Unlike other Jyotirlingas associated with healing or auspiciousness, Mahakaleshwar is the embodiment of entropy, the force that dissolves the universe at the end of an epoch. The underground sanctum houses the only South-facing Jyotirlinga, confronting Yama (Death) directly. The daily Bhasma Aarti, where the Linga is smeared with cremation ash at dawn, is a visceral reminder of mortality and liberation.",
